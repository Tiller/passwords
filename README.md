Unique Passwords
================

Sets of tools to generate unique passwords from a set of data (user, domain, length, master password).

I AM NOT THE ORIGINAL CREATOR OF THE GENERATOR!

You can find in this repository:
- a html file which is +/- the same as the original (I think the only difference is that the master password is case sensitive)
- a GreaseMonkey script for Firefox that offers the possibility to use the generator over any password field (by pressing 'Tab' while being on an empty password field)
- an APK (and its sources) of an Android's keyboard that uses the same generator.

### Special notes

The different components are NOT OPTIMIZED AT ALL. The code HAS NOT BE CLEANED. I developed these tools for my own usage. I publish them only because I think they are quite useful additions to the original generator.

Comments are welcome, bugs reports too. However, I do not plan to maintain these things that much.
